# FiniteNet
Code for the FiniteNet ICML Paper. To run this code, simply put the HelperFunctions.py file into your directory, along with any data you wish to use or trained models you wish to evaluate. Then run one of the attached scripts that start with 'test' or 'train' to test or train a FiniteNet model.
